# LSTM-based Tandem Repeat Detector

To run this python code, you must have a Nvidia Video card with CUDA Compute Capability greater than 8.0. You may also need to install the following python packages:

- pytorch
- matplotlib
- biopython
- numpy

Please be awared that some parameters of the LSTM is changed across the files. Therefore, some **pkl** files may not fit in to some programs.

The best result is the **.py** file having the largest number, e.g. **test[_LARGEST NUMBER_]_{some_feature_name}**.
